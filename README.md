# nbody-sandbox
n-body(orbital) physics simulation toy

Made this for a differential equations project(3-body problem)to demonstrate how numerical solutions can work. Also used it as an excuse to play around with gamemaker studio a bit(html/js rendered in gms)

[click here to play](http://24.144.8.148/nbody/nbody.html)

To do:
- option to manipulate particle masses
- improve the algorithm(need to implement a solid matrix solution, right now it starts to chug around 200 particles)
- improve collision detection
- options to manipulate gravity, time, and scale
